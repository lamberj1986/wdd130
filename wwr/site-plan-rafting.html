        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Have you ever wanted to go rafting, but have never had the chance to to do so? Have you ever thought that rafting costs too much for you to go? Well we have a plan in place that makes it easy to overcome both of these problems. We enjoy rafting so much here that we want to take everybody along for a ride, letting everybody share in our passion. Hopefully we will get to see you on the rapids soon!</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Here at our rafting compnay we want to help those who have not had an opportunity to enjoy the rapids to get out and see what white water rafting is all about. Due to safety concerns, we do need to ensure that the youngest rafter that comes with us is at least 12 years old. For those rafters that are between the ages of 12 and 18, we do require that and has an adult rafting with them. We hope that you will join us in enjoying the thrill of going down the river and hitting all of the rapids that we can. We know that this may be the mising piece in your life, a thrill that you will always look back on and smile.</p>
