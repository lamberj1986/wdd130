        <p>Hello! I am Jeff Lambert and I currently live in Michigan. I enjoy spending time with my family especially getting to spend time playing with all of my daughters. In the evenings you'll typically catch me watching various TV shows with my wife such as Fringe, How I Met Your Mother, or Psych.</p>

        <h2>Lowell, MI</h2>
        <img src="images/lowell-michigan-snow.jpg" alt="A quiet downtown Lowell as the snow falls" width="200">
        <p>Living in Michigan has been an amazing experience, since moving from Denver to Lowell we have moved back in time where people don't lock their cars or homes, they trust each other, and know how to say hi when passing on the street. I love being in a small town with all of the perks that come with it.</p>
